## Advanced Python Keylogger for Windows

Keyboard capturing is the action of recording the keys stroke on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that the person
using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored

### Uses
Some uses of a keylogger are:
- Security Testing: improving the protection against hidden key loggers;
- Business Administration: Monitor what employees are doing (with their consent);
- School/Institutions: Track keystrokes and log banned words in a file;
- Personal Control and File Backup: Make sure no one is using your computer when you are away;
- Parental Control: Track what your children are doing;
- Self-analysis and assessment.
